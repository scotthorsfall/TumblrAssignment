## Tumblr

The purpose of this homework is to leverage animations and gestures to create custom navigation. We're going to use the techniques from this week to implement some interactions in Tumblr.

Time spent: 7

### Features

#### Required

* Tapping on Home, Search, Account, or Trending should show the respective screen and highlight the tab bar button.
* Compose button should modally present the compose screen.

#### Optional

* Compose screen is faded in while the buttons animate in.
* Login button should show animate the login form over the view controller.
* Discover bubble should bob up and down until the SearchViewController is tapped.

#### The following **additional** features are implemented:

* Stored compose icons in an array

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. If there's a better way to programmatically delay and animate the compose icons, rather than separate blocks
2. Slight frusturation, but is there a way to move things around in the storyboard without them embedding into other views/scroll views?

### Video Walkthrough 

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:
